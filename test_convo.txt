PC:	.. scanning Quadrant 3, 216 to 322 degrees. Delta V looks good. Report on Quadrant 1, how are we looking Barry?

Barry:	Everything's fine mate.

PC:	I beg your pardon, Barry?

Barry:	All good.

PC:	Barry. I know we've been out here a long time but that doesn't give you licence to drop protocol whenever you feel like it. Got it?

Barry:	[heaves a sign] Yes SIR Lieutanant SIR sorry SIR.

PC:	Systems report, John?

John:	It's fine, it's whatever.

PC:	JOHN.

John:	What? What do you want me to say? It's exactly the same as it was last shift. We haven't done anything since last shift. It's all the same as last shift.

[first dialogue puzzle, returns to the top of the choices tree until John is prompted to check his console]

PC:	
	1- What's gotten into you two?
		--John & Barry:		- Nothing.

	2- One more outburst like that and I'll have to file a record of insubordination!
		- John:	--- Oh no, not that. Please, anything but that.
			PC:	- John you are an Engineer in the Australian National Astrophysics League. What does that mean to you?
				John:	It means I get to spend the best years of my life in deep space.
					PC:	1.- Exactly! It's the adventure of a lifetime!
						John:	1a--- Oh it's a hoot.

						2.- You don't sound very enthusiastic.
						John:	--- I wonder why.
							PC:	-If you don't like it, you can always quit.
								John:	---Wait, really?
									PC:	-Of course. But that means you won't have access to any ship-distributed food.

										John:	---Oh.
											PC:	-Or oxygen.
												John:	---That doesn't sounds as bad as you you might think actually.
	3- Are you sure nothing's changed?
		--- John:	- Yes I'm sure.
			- PC:	- Are you really sure?
				---John:	Yes I'm really sure.
					PC:	- Are you really really sure?
						John:	--- Yes I'm really really sure.
							PC:	- Are you really really extra sure?
								John:	--- Yes I'm really really extra sure.
									PC:	- Are you really really extra super-duper positive cross-my-EVA-suit-and-hope-to-be-blown-out-the-airlock sure?
										John:	--- YES.
											PC:	- Check your console anyway.
												John:	--- OKAY, FINE.
													PC:	- "Sir".
														John:	--- ... SIR.





	4- Well that's good to know.
		-- Barry: Playing favourites, are we?
			- PC:	1- What are you talking about?
				Barry:	- You chew my ear off when I talk like that but he gets away with anything.
					PC:	--- That's not true.
						Barry:	-- Yes it is.
							- PC:	No it isn't.
								Barry:	-- Yes it is.
									PC: - No it isn't.
										Barry:	-- Yes it is!
											PC:	Who's Lieutenant?
												Barry:	-- ... you are.
													PC:	That's right.
				2- No.
					--Barry:	It sure looks like it.
				3- Of course not.
					--Barry:	Yeah, right.
				4- Yes.
					--Barry		I knew it.

[John taps at his console]

John:	See? Everything's...

PC:	Everything's..?

John:	Probably fine. SIR.

[Start animation of Barry slowly, gradually sinking lower into his chair]

PC:	Could you be a bit clearer on what you mean by "probably"?

John:	It looks the same as before, like I said. SIR.

PC:	It LOOKS the same or it IS the same?

John:	It LOOKS like it IS the same. SIR.

PC:	So can you CONFIRM that is IS the same?

John:	... not exactly. SIR.

PC:	Why not?

John:	My console is... in Russian.

[pause]

PC:	Your console is in Russian?

John:	My console is in Russian. SIR.

[pause]

PC:	Could you explain why your console is in Russian, John?

[pause]

John:	No Sir.

[pause. PC and John both look at Barry, who is barely peeking above his console]

PC:	Do you know anything about this, Barry?

Barry:	Possibly.

PC:	I really need a clearer answer than that Barry. Why is John's console in Russian?

Barry:	Well, it was an accident.

[pause]
	I was bored.
[pause]
	So I was looking for a new hobby. And I thought hey, why not try learning a new language?
[pause]
	And they say immersion is the quickest way to pick up a new language, so I switched the ship's computer interface to Russian to see what it looked like.
[pause]
	And I couldn't quite find how to switch it back.
[pause]
	It turns out language immersion takes a fairly long time.

PC:	You said you switched the SHIP'S COMPUTER interface?

Barry:	Uh, yes Sir.

PC:	So that's going to affect everyone's cons...

[ All crew look at their consoles. pause]

PC:	Oh Barry, you idiot.

Barry:	I feel really bad about it Sir.

John:	Computer's voice recognition should still be working though.

PC:	Computer!

Computer: [angry shouting voice] ZATKNIS, YA ZANYAT! SHTO HOCHESH?

[pause]

PC:	Barry, you complete idiot.
