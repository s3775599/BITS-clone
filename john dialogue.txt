		-->: I don't know.
			JOHN: Well, neither do I.
		-->: You're an engineer, aren't you?
			JOHN:
			You could says I'm an "engineer". You could also say that I modelled a nuclear reactor out of pinebark when I was 12, I have a first-class degree in quantum propulsion systems, and I was headhunted by the Australian National Astrophysics League before I'd even taken my final exams with promises of overseeing the biggest and most powerful engines humanity had ever devised.
			
			Then these stupid AI computers came along and now I press buttons all day asking the computer to find answers to things I devoted my life to studying, and the only tech I'm allowed to go anywhere near is the coffee machine.

			And we ran out of coffee three years ago.
		
			But sure. "Engineer".

			PC:
			--->: I bet you could fix it.
				JOHN: I bet you I'm not going to.
			--->: Can you think of some way to fix this?
				JOHN: I don't think a lowly "engineer" has any business fiddling with a G38k Kermit Quantum AI Nanoflux Supercomputer.
				PC:
				---->: I bet you'd like to though.
					JOHN: ...
					[loops until all choices are selected, in any order]
					PC:
					----->: I bet you really hate that computer.
						JOHN: ...
					----->: I bet you're disappointed that the League reduced you to a button-pushing errand-boy.
						JOHN: ...
					----->: I bet you feel like you really wasted your youth on all that study.
						JOHN: ...
					----->: I bet you'd really like to show this computer how you really feel.
						JOHN: ...

						JOHN: AAARRRRRRRGH!!

				JOHN: We used the last of the WD40 on the squeaky chair in the comms room.
			--->: What if you restart the synaptic motivators?
				JOHN: I don't think I could begin to explain in simple terms why that wouldn't work.
			--->: What about flooding the vac inhibitors with sodium trihydroflurodoxetine to trigger an hydrolygesic feedback decouplement?
				JOHN: Yes I thought about that but we don't have enough methylaluniminestricate to counter to secondary neurotrioxin-3 inversion.

->: I'm scared, John.
	JOHN: Oh, give me a break.
