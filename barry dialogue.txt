BARRY DIALOGUE PUZZLE

->: I'm very disappointed in you, Barry.
	BARRY: I don't know how this could have happened, Sir.
		-->: That's a bit difficult to believe, Barry.
			BARRY: Uh, I  suppose so.
		-->: Well, we need to find a way to fix it now.
			BARRY: Yes sir. I'm working on it right now, Sir.
		-->: I imagine it had something to do with you fiddling with computer settings you had no business interfering with.
			BARRY: Uh, true.

->: How could you do this, Barry?
	BARRY: I didn't mean to do it, Sir.
		PC:
		-->: You didn't mean to make the computer virtually impossible to use, thus jeopardising the crew, the ship and the mission?
			BARRY: Uh, that's correct Sir.
				PC:
				--->: Well, that's great. As long as you're sorry.
					BARRY: I'm very sorry Sir.
					[pause]
					BARRY: I'll still need to fix this though, won't I?
						PC:
						---->: Yes, Barry. You need to fix the computer so we don't all die from your idiocy. That would be very good of you.
				--->: I'm pleased to hear it. I was about to put you on report, but since you seem so sincerely sorry, I'll let you off.
					BARRY: Really, Sir?
						PC:
						---->: No, Barry, you colossal moron.
->: Barry, you need to fix this.
	BARRY: I know Sir, I'm working on it.
	PC:
	-->: Let me know how you get on.
		BARRY: Yes Sir, I will Sir.
	-->: What are you doing to fix it?
		BARRY: I'm going to try something.
			PC:
			--->: What's that?
				BARRY: I'm going to try pressing a button.
				[pause]
				BARRY: Nope, nothing.
			--->: Wait, I have an idea.
				BARRY: What's that Sir?
					PC:
					---->: What kind of training did you get when you were qualifying to be a Pilot?
						BARRY: Aerodynamics, calculus, spatial geometry, mechanical engineering, first aid, how to drink 7 shots of rum and vomit out your nose, navigation...
					PC:
					----->: Navigation! Wait, seven shots and what? No, nevermind actually.
						BARRY: What about navigation, Sir?
							------>: You must have learned about observing your surroundings, noticing minor details and changes of scenery?
								BARRY: Uh, yes Sir I suppose so.
									PC:
									------->: If you replay the scene in your head, can you visualise the console again? All the keys and screens you saw to change the language the first time?
										BARRY: ...
										[pause]
										BARRY: Actually, Sir, I think I just about can.
										[Barry types at his console]
										BARRY: Yes... yes..... yes! YES! I've got it!
											PC:
											-------->: You've fixed it?
												BARRY: Uh, not completely Sir. But it looks like it's a little bit better. I'll keep trying. [Barry has fixed the computer interfadce by -%]
												
					---->: Try pushing random buttons.
						BARRY: Are you sure, Sir?
							PC:
							----->: Yes.
								BARRY: Okay, Sir. Here goes...
								[pause]
								BARRY: So much for that. [[[OPTION FOR COMIC EFFECT HERE - POSS. FLASHING LIGHT OR ANNOYING SONG STARTS PLAYING]]]
							----->: No.
					---->: I think you should not touch anything and let me and John try to fix this.
						BARRY: If you say so, Sir.
					
			--->: Whatever it is Barry, you had better have a good plan.
				BARRY: ...
					PC:
					---->: Barry?
						BARRY: ...
							PC:
							----->: You were going to start pushing random buttons, weren't you Barry?
								BARRY: Kind of yes, Sir. Sorry Sir.
	-->: Do you know what's going to happen if you don't sort this out?
		BARRY: I can imagine, Sir.

			PC:
			--->: Can you imagine not being able to order those spicy kebabs from the food dispenser?
				BARRY: Oh, god... or the samosas!
					PC:
					---->: Get to work, Barry.
			--->: Can you imagine not being able to activate the turbolift to get back to your quarters?
				BARRY: So we're stuck here?
					---->: And getting angrier by the minute.
			--->: Can you imagine the crew collectively stuffing you into the airlock?
				BARRY: But they won't be able to open the outer doors without a voice confirmation.
					PC:
					---->: I'm sure they'd figure something out.
			--->: Can you imagine what the rest of the crew is going to do to us if they find out?
				BARRY: I'm trying not to.

->: I don't understand, Barry.
	BARRY: Don't understand what, Sir?
		-->: How could you change the language settings like that? Didn't it need an admin password?
			BARRY: Yes Sir, it did.
				PC:
				--->: Do you have some higher authorisation that I don't know about?
					BARRY: No Sir, it was just luck.
						PC:
						---->: "password"?
							BARRY: No, Sir.
						---->: "qwerty"?
							BARRY: No, Sir.
						---->: "12345678"?
							BARRY: No, Sir.
						---->: "ford"?
							BARRY: No, Sir.
				--->: How did you know what the captain's password was?
					BARRY: Someone left a sticky note with the password on my console from the last shift.
						PC:
						---->: I guess that means someone else is first up for cleaning the heads next Saturday, at least.

		-->: Why did you think you could learn a new language so quickly?
			BARRY: I heard that when you go to a new country you learn the language really quickly.
				PC:
				--->: How quickly?
					BARRY: Uh, I don't know. I guess.. a few months instead of a few years?
					PC:
					---->:Barry, stop talking.
				--->: Changing the computer interface isn't like going to a new country. It's like you picking up a foreign book and trying to read it immediately.
					BARRY: Yes, Sir. I realised that after about three seconds.
						PC:
						---->: Barry, stop talking.
		-->: Why didn't you tell us as soon as it happened?
			BARRY: I was a bit embarrassed and hoped maybe it wouldn't be that noticeable.
				PC:
				--->: You thought that we wouldn't notice that the computer was IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE?
					BARRY: It kind of looks a bit like English.
						PC:
						---->: Barry.
							BARRY: A little bit.
							PC:
							----->: Barry.
								BARRY: A couple of the letters look the same.
								PC:
								------>: Barry, stop talking.
